<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a committed data scientist with profound interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence at large. 
  I am still in the process of sharpening my skills and put them in practice. 
  I have worked on several projects that might be of concern to you,(take alook on the home page of you don't mind).
  I am currently getting to study Neural Networks and get to understand their functionality</p>

<p>My undergraduate degree was in Financial Engineering where I acquired a foundational knowledge on finance, statistics 
  and mathematics. Computer interactive statistics that I undertook here gave me the push to pursue data related
 professional courses that have really impacted my current career.</p>

<p>I also have foundational skills on web development that were necessary for packaging of my data products that I
   usually create at any given point in time.
  Feel me to contact me for any professional services within my line of work.</p>
